# ROMBO: Bayesian Optimization using nonintrusive Reduced Order Models

A Python framework for adaptive nonintrusive data-driven reduced-order modeling and its applications to Bayesian optimization.

The framework is built utilizing PyTorch and associated libraries. Modular base classes have been provided for users to implement their own ROM architectures and utilize them within this framework.
