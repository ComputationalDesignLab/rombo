# AROMAD: Adaptive Reduced Order Modeling for Analysis and Design

A Python framework for adaptive non-intrusive data-driven reduced-order modelling and its applications to design optimization.

The framework is built utilizing PyTorch and associated libraries. Modular base classes have been provided for users to implement their own ROM architectures and utilize them within this framework.
